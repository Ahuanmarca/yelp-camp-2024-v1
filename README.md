# YelpCamp MERN

**Work in progress**

"YelpCamp MERN" is a full stack web application created with MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. This project is based on YelpCamp from "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele. https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/.

This version of YelpCamp is refactored to use React at the frontend instead of the EJS templating language, so it's divided in a client and a server app. The Express server receives requests and sends data. It doesn't render any templates.
